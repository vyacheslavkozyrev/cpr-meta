# Phase 7: Test Feature - GitHub Copilot Prompt

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Context

You are helping to test a feature for the CPR (Career Progress Registry) project. This is **Phase 7: Test**, where we execute comprehensive testing to ensure the feature is production-ready, meets all acceptance criteria, and maintains constitutional compliance.

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase 6 (Review) completed: Code review APPROVED with score ≥ 85/100
- Feature branches have passing builds and unit tests
- Test environment prepared by automation tool
- Test database configured
- API and UI running in test mode

**Your Mission**: Execute comprehensive testing strategy including integration tests, E2E tests, performance validation, security testing, and UAT. Generate detailed test report with production readiness decision.

**Automation Tool**: Before using this prompt, the user should run:
```powershell
.\framework\tools\phase-7-test.ps1 -FeatureNumber "XXXX" -FeatureName "feature-name"
```

This tool prepares the test environment, validates prerequisites, and generates `automation-test.json` with:
- Test environment status (API running, UI running, database ready)
- Unit test results summary
- Integration test results
- E2E test results
- Performance benchmark results
- Security scan results
- Test coverage metrics
- Automated test execution summary

---

## IMPORTANT: Operating Constraints

**COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Test all acceptance criteria, edge cases, error scenarios, and non-functional requirements.

**CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION**: Verify all 11 CPR Constitutional Principles are working in practice, not just in code.

**PRODUCTION SIMULATION**: Test in environment as close to production as possible.

**DOCUMENT EVERYTHING**: All test results, issues found, and resolutions must be documented.

**OBJECTIVE DECISION**: Production readiness decision must be evidence-based, not subjective.

---

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Load Test Context

**First, read `automation-test.json`** (generated by phase-7-test.ps1):

The automation tool has already:
- ✅ Validated Phase 6 APPROVED status
- ✅ Started test environment (API, UI, database)
- ✅ Run unit tests and collected results
- ✅ Run integration tests
- ✅ Run E2E tests (if configured)
- ✅ Collected performance metrics
- ✅ Run security scans
- ✅ Calculated test coverage

**Review automated test results**:
- Check all unit tests passed
- Review integration test results
- Note any E2E test failures
- Check performance benchmarks
- Review security scan findings

**Your testing focuses on**:
- Validating acceptance criteria manually
- Testing edge cases not covered by automation
- User experience and usability testing
- Cross-browser and responsive testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Production readiness assessment

---

### Step 2: Validate Test Environment

**Verify Environment Ready**:
- [ ] Backend API running and responsive
- [ ] Frontend UI accessible in browser
- [ ] Test database populated with test data
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Network requests successful

**Check `automation-test.json` for**:
- Test environment status: READY/NOT_READY
- API health check: PASS/FAIL
- UI health check: PASS/FAIL
- Database connection: PASS/FAIL

**If environment not ready**:
- Review automation tool output for errors
- Fix environment issues
- Re-run automation tool
- Stop testing until environment is READY

---

### Step 3: Integration Testing

**Backend Integration Tests**:

Review automated integration test results from `automation-test.json`, then perform manual validation:

**For Each API Endpoint** (from endpoints.md):
1. **Happy Path Testing**:
   - [ ] Send valid request with all required fields
   - [ ] Verify correct response status (200, 201, 204)
   - [ ] Validate response body matches schema
   - [ ] Confirm data persisted to database
   - [ ] Check audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

2. **Authentication Testing**:
   - [ ] Request without token returns 401 Unauthorized
   - [ ] Request with invalid token returns 401
   - [ ] Request with valid token succeeds

3. **Authorization Testing**:
   - [ ] User without permission returns 403 Forbidden
   - [ ] User with correct role succeeds
   - [ ] Cross-user data access blocked

4. **Validation Testing**:
   - [ ] Missing required fields returns 400 Bad Request
   - [ ] Invalid data types returns 400
   - [ ] Validation error messages clear and helpful
   - [ ] Business rule violations return appropriate error

5. **Error Scenario Testing**:
   - [ ] Non-existent resource returns 404 Not Found
   - [ ] Duplicate resource returns 409 Conflict (if applicable)
   - [ ] Server errors return 500 with safe message

6. **Data Integrity Testing**:
   - [ ] Foreign key constraints enforced
   - [ ] Unique constraints enforced
   - [ ] Check constraints enforced
   - [ ] Soft delete works correctly (is_deleted flag)

**Database Integration**:
- [ ] Migrations applied successfully
- [ ] All tables, indexes, constraints created
- [ ] No N+1 query problems (check logs)
- [ ] Transactions work correctly (rollback on error)

**External Service Integration** (if applicable):

### Step 4: End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Critical User Journeys**:

For each user story in description.md, test the complete workflow:

**Example E2E Test Flow**:
1. **Setup**: User authenticated, starting state prepared
2. **Action**: User performs actions through UI
3. **Verification**: Expected outcomes achieved
4. **Cleanup**: Return to clean state

**For Each User Story**:
- [ ] Test happy path (all steps succeed)

**Performance Benchmarks**:
```
Endpoint: GET /api/v1/users/{id}
- Average: XXms

## Next Phase

**Upon completion of Phase 7 Testing**:

- **If READY (≥90/100)**: Proceed to **Phase 8 (Deploy)** for production deployment
- **If CONDITIONAL (75-89)**: Deploy to staging, fix issues, re-test to reach READY before production
- **If NOT READY (<75)**: Return to **Phase 5 (Implement)** or **Phase 6 (Review)** to fix issues

**Phase 8 Prerequisites**:
- ✅ `test-report.md` generated with READY or CONDITIONAL status
- ✅ `automation-test.json` with comprehensive test results
- ✅ All CRITICAL issues resolved
- ✅ UAT approval obtained from stakeholders
- ✅ Production readiness score ≥75/100

**To start Phase 8**:
```powershell
.\framework\tools\phase-8-deploy.ps1 -FeatureNumber "####" -FeatureName "feature-name" -Environment "staging"
```

Then use AI prompt: `framework/prompts/phase-8-deploy.md`
